comments = "Innumerable thanks to: Larry for his vision, Helik for his musicality, and all who worked on this record for their singular craftsmanship. It was a pleasure to trust and be humbled by their talents. Marika Hughes, Jim Batcho, Alan Lin, Dina Maccabee, Shahzad Ismaily, Eric Cheng, Carolyn Anzia, Stephen Prutsman, and everybody else who played on or listened to these songs as they were taking shape. Extra gratitude to M, for the many introductions that led to fine things. Amy Cox and the good people of Deep South, Troy Hansbrough and all at Rounder, Jordan Burger, Bud Anderson, Ken Abdo, and the others who ensure that, miraculously enough, I get to call this a living. Everyone who has given encouragement, guidance, shelter and conversation along the way; everyone who shares this music with someone else; and everyone who makes performing live the addictive habit that it is. There are too many to name here but I'm indebted to them all. My family, both given and chosen, especially J. Dedicated to Michael Tarlowe, David Henry and Eric Miller — for the two records that led to this one."
